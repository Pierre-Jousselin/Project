## Features

- **Data Sources**: 
  - **Energy Load Data**: Sourced from the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform.
  - **Weather Data**: Historical and forecast data retrieved using the Open-Meteo API.
- **Storage**: MongoDB used for data management with separate databases for energy, weather, features, and predictions.
- **Modeling**: 
  - Four region-specific Random Forest models trained to account for variations in energy consumption.
  - Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search.
- **Daily Pipelines**:
  - Automated retrieval and updates for energy and weather data.
- **Predictions and Monitoring**:
  - 10-day energy load predictions stored in the database.
  - Performance tracked using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Energy data aggregated to daily values for consistency.
   - Weather data collected for four cities per region, capturing temperature, wind speed, precipitation, etc.

2. **Data Management**:
   - Databases designed for weather, energy, and feature views.
   - Prediction database for monitoring inference results.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Separate models for SE1, SE2, SE3, and SE4 to account for regional differences.
   - Random Forest models trained with weather and energy data features.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Dashboard for real-time monitoring and visualization of predictions.

## Dependencies
